OUR PROJECT

We created a web application named Cookery&Delivery, when you are not sure whether to cook or order in. 
The purpose of this app is to give the user options for their next meal.  There is a recipe search by type of food that returns eight options. There is also a restaurant search by zip code and food type. The user can then decide whether to cook or call and order food. The last page is for the user to add their favorite recipe links.
